# Search Engine Coverage Test TODO Items

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Implement Missing Methods in SearchEngine Class:**
   - Add all required search feature methods to the `SearchEngine` class:
     - `text_search`: Method for performing text-based searches
     - `image_search`: Method for performing image-based searches
     - `voice_search`: Method for performing voice-based searches
     - `exact_match`: Method for exact string matching
     - `fuzzy_match`: Method for approximate string matching
     - `string_exclusion`: Method for excluding specific strings from results
     - `filter_criteria`: Method for applying arbitrary filtering criteria
     - `ranking_algorithm`: Method for sorting and ranking search results
     - `multi_field_search`: Method for searching across multiple fields
     - `query_parser`: Method for parsing and normalizing search queries

2. **Update Resource Dictionary:**
   - Modify the `resources` dictionary in the `SearchEngine` initialization to include all required functionality
   - Ensure proper dependency injection for each feature

3. **Remove NotImplementedError Placeholders:**
   - Replace the placeholder `NotImplementedError` raises with actual implementations
   - Update tests to verify the actual functionality of each method

## Feature Weight Determination

**Implement Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process:**
- Develop a fuzzy AHP function to determine the precise weights for each feature
- Current placeholder weights are on a scale of 1-10 (1 arbitrary, 2 least, 10 most)
- Actual weights should be determined based on:
  - Business requirements and priorities
  - User needs assessment
  - Technical feasibility
  - Impact on overall search quality
  - Alignment with MVP success criteria

## Mock Creation

**Develop Proper Mock Objects:**
- Create detailed mock objects for each search feature
- These mocks should simulate the expected behavior of each component
- Define input/output contracts for each mock to ensure test validity

## Coverage Threshold Review

**Evaluate Coverage Threshold Requirements:**
- The current threshold is set at 100% (1.0), requiring all features to be implemented
- Review whether this threshold is practical based on MVP requirements
- Consider adjusting to a more flexible threshold (e.g., 95%) if appropriate

## Test Enhancement

**Additional Test Cases:**
- Add more detailed test cases for each feature once implemented
- Include edge cases, error conditions, and performance scenarios
- Consider integration tests between related features

## Documentation

**Update Class Documentation:**
- Enhance docstrings for the `SearchEngine` class to reflect all features
- Document the role of each feature in the overall search architecture
- Provide usage examples for each method

## Metrics Reporting

**Implement Coverage Reporting:**
- Create a mechanism to report search coverage metrics during CI/CD
- Generate visual representations of feature implementation status
- Track coverage trends over time
