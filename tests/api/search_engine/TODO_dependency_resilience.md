# Dependency Resilience Test TODO Items

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Implement Dependency Resilience Methods in SearchEngine Class:**
   - Add the following methods for resilience measurement and management:
     - `measure_dependency_resilience`: Calculate overall resilience ratio
     - `track_dependency_failure`: Record dependency failures and recovery attempts
     - `reset_dependency_tracking`: Reset dependency tracking counters
     - `get_dependency_resilience`: Get resilience metrics for specific dependencies
     - `circuit_breaker_status`: Implement circuit breaker pattern for dependency management

2. **Develop Failure Recovery Mechanisms:**
   - Implement graceful handling for different types of failures:
     - Database connection failures
     - Query execution errors
     - Search service unavailability
     - Processing errors

3. **Implement Dependency Monitoring:**
   - Create a system to monitor dependency health
   - Implement alerting for degraded dependencies
   - Add comprehensive logging for dependency failures

## Resilience Implementation

**Dependency Resilience Methodology:**
- Implement robust error handling for all dependencies:
  - Database connections and queries
  - External services and APIs
  - Resource allocations
  - Internal components
- Add fallback mechanisms for critical components:
  - Cached results when database is unavailable
  - Simplified search when advanced algorithms fail
  - Local resources when external services are down
- Implement circuit breaker pattern:
  - Track failure rates for each dependency
  - Temporarily disable dependencies that exceed failure thresholds
  - Automatically test recovery after cooling period
  - Gradually restore traffic after successful recovery

## Threshold Configuration

**Resilience Threshold Management:**
- The current threshold is set at 0.9 (90%)
- Make thresholds configurable based on:
  - Dependency criticality
  - Availability requirements
  - Business impact of failures
  - Recovery capabilities
- Consider implementing tiered thresholds:
  - Critical dependencies: 0.95 (95%)
  - Important dependencies: 0.9 (90%)
  - Secondary dependencies: 0.8 (80%)

## Failure Injection Framework

**Enhance Failure Injection Framework:**
- Create a comprehensive failure injection system that can:
  - Simulate different types of dependency failures
  - Create partial or complete failures
  - Generate temporary or persistent failures
  - Model cascading failures across dependencies
- Implement chaos engineering principles:
  - Regular, scheduled failure testing
  - Randomized failure scenarios
  - Gradual degradation testing
  - Recovery time measurement

## Recovery Testing

**Develop Recovery Testing Framework:**
- Test recovery from various failure scenarios:
  - Database connection loss
  - Query timeout
  - External service unavailability
  - Resource exhaustion
- Measure key recovery metrics:
  - Mean time to detect (MTTD)
  - Mean time to recovery (MTTR)
  - Recovery success rate
  - Performance during recovery

## Circuit Breaker Implementation

**Implement Full Circuit Breaker Pattern:**
- Create a configurable circuit breaker that:
  - Monitors dependency health in real-time
  - Tracks failure counts and rates
  - Automatically opens circuit after threshold violations
  - Implements half-open state for testing recovery
  - Provides status API for monitoring systems
- Configure circuit breaker parameters:
  - Failure count threshold
  - Failure rate threshold
  - Circuit open duration
  - Half-open test frequency
  - Recovery success threshold

## Asynchronous Implementation

**Async Support Development:**
- Ensure resilience mechanisms work correctly with async/await patterns
- Implement async-compatible circuit breakers
- Add timeout handling for async operations
- Prepare for future async database implementation

## Documentation

**Update Resilience Documentation:**
- Document expected failure scenarios and recovery mechanisms
- Provide configuration guidelines for resilience settings
- Create runbooks for handling different types of failures
- Document circuit breaker behavior and configuration

## Resilience Reporting

**Implement Resilience Reporting System:**
- Create dashboards for dependency health monitoring
- Implement trend analysis for resilience metrics
- Develop automated reports on system resilience
- Track recovery performance over time
