# Search Engine Error Rate Test Metric

## Error Rate Equation

$$E_{rate} = \frac{N_{errors}}{N_{total}} < E_{threshold}$$

Where:
- $E_{rate}$: Error rate across all search operations
- $N_{errors}$: Number of search operations resulting in errors
- $N_{total}$: Total number of search operations performed
- $E_{threshold}$: Maximum acceptable error rate (e.g., 0.01 or 1%)

## Detailed Definitions

### Error ($N_{errors}$)
An "error" in this context refers to any search attempt that does not successfully complete its intended function and return valid results to the caller. This includes:
- Exceptions thrown and not recovered within the orchestration layer
- Search operations that time out beyond configured thresholds
- Dependency failures that prevent completion (database unavailability, etc.)
- Malformed responses that violate the expected contract
- Silent failures where a search returned no results when it should have

### Search Operation ($N_{total}$)
A "search operation" is defined as any complete invocation of the search orchestrator from initial request receipt to final response delivery. This encompasses:
- A single call to any public-facing search method in the orchestrator
- The entire lifecycle of query processing, execution, and result formatting
- All types of searches (text, image, voice) count equally as one operation
- Batch searches count as multiple operations (one per individual search in the batch)

The Error Rate metric specifically measures the reliability of the search system by tracking the proportion of search operations that fail to complete successfully against the total number of attempted operations, regardless of search type or complexity.
