            <h2>No Attorney-Client Relationship or Legal Advice</h2>
            <p>Communication of information by, in, to or through this Web site and your receipt or use of it (1) is not provided in the course of and does not create or constitute an attorney-client relationship, (2) is not intended as a solicitation, (3) is not intended to convey or constitute legal advice, and (4) is not a substitute for obtaining legal advice from a qualified attorney. You should not act upon any such information without first seeking qualified professional counsel on your specific matter. The hiring of an attorney is an important decision that should not be based solely upon Web site communications or advertisements.</p>
            
            <p>You understand that the communication between you and this Web site may not be considered confidential. You also should not rely upon the transmission of an e-mail message to an attorney through this Web site to create an attorney-client relationship. The transmission or exchange of information will not do so. Without an attorney-client relationship in the matter, we cannot assure you that your communications will be privileged or (unless we otherwise agree in a specific case) that we will treat them as such. Please do not send us any confidential or sensitive information until you speak with one of our attorneys and obtain prior written authorization to send that information to us.</p>

            <h2>AI-Generated Content Notice</h2>
            <p>This search engine utilizes artificial intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze legal information and generate portions of search results. While we strive for accuracy, AI-generated content may contain errors, omissions, or outdated information; is not a substitute for professional legal advice; has inherent limitations in interpreting complex legal concepts; and cannot account for all jurisdiction-specific nuances in the law.</p>

Any representation or warranty that might be otherwise implied is expressly disclaimed.</p>

            <p>You agree that we are not liable to you or others, in any way or for any damages of any kind or under any theory, arising from this site, or your access to or use of or reliance on the information in or through this site, including but not limited to errors in AI-generated content, misinterpretation of legal information, reliance on outdated legal standards, technical inaccuracies in search results, or any actions taken based on information provided.</p>
