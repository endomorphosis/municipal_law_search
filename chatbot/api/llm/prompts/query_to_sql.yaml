    4. For queries about specific states, filter by state_name or state_code
    5. For queries about specific places, filter by place_name
    6. Limit results to a reasonable number (default 10)
    7. Include ORDER BY clauses for relevance
    8. When searching text in the html table, use the html field

    Return ONLY the SQL query without any explanations.
