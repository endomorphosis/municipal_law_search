# Search Engine Dependency Resilience Metric

## Formal Definition

$R_{dependency} = \frac{N_{recovered}}{N_{failures}} > R_{threshold}$

Where:
- $R_{dependency}$: Resilience against dependency failures
- $N_{recovered}$: Number of gracefully handled dependency failures
- $N_{failures}$: Total number of dependency failures encountered
- $R_{threshold}$: Minimum acceptable resilience ratio (e.g., 0.9 or 90%)

## Dependency Failures Definition

In the context of our search orchestration system, "dependency failures" refer to any situation where an external system or service that our orchestrator relies on becomes unavailable, responds with errors, experiences performance degradation, or behaves unexpectedly. Specifically:

### 1. Database Dependency Failures
- SQL database connection failures
- SQL query execution errors
- Vector database connection timeouts
- Vector search operation errors

### 2. API Dependency Failures
- FastAPI endpoint unavailability
- Request timeout issues
- Invalid response formats
- Authentication/authorization failures

### 3. Resource Dependency Failures
- Memory allocation failures
- CPU resource constraints
- Network connectivity issues
- File system access problems

### 4. Service Dependency Failures
- Third-party search service outages
- Internal microservice unavailability
- Cache service failures
- Message queue failures

## Graceful Handling Definition

Graceful handling of dependency failures is defined as the system's ability to:
1. Detect the failure quickly and accurately
2. Log detailed information about the failure
3. Implement appropriate fallback behaviors where possible
4. Provide clear, actionable error messages to users or calling systems
5. Attempt automatic recovery when appropriate
6. Maintain system stability despite the failure

The resilience metric tracks the proportion of dependency failures that were handled according to these graceful handling criteria, with the goal of maintaining this proportion above the defined threshold.
