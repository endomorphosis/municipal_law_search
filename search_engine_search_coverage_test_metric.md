# Search Coverage Test Metric

## Equation
$C_{search} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot f_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i} > C_{threshold}$

Where:
- $C_{search}$: Weighted coverage of search features
- $n$: Total number of required search features
- $w_i$: Weight of importance for feature $i$
- $f_i$: Binary indicator if feature $i$ is implemented (1) or not (0)
- $C_{threshold}$: Minimum acceptable coverage ratio (e.g., 0.95 or 95%)

## Detailed Definitions

### Search Feature ($f_i$)
A "search feature" refers to a specific functionality that the search orchestrator must provide. These include:

1. Text search capability
2. Image search capability
3. Voice search capability
4. String matching (exact matches)
5. String matching (fuzzy matches)
6. String exclusion capability
7. Arbitrary filtering criteria support
8. Result ranking algorithms
9. Multi-field search capability
10. Search query parsing and normalization

Each feature is binary (implemented or not implemented) in our equation.

### Importance Weight ($w_i$)
The "importance" weight represents the relative priority or criticality of each search feature to the overall system success. Weights are assigned on a scale (e.g., 1-10) where:

- Higher weights (e.g., 8-10): Core features essential for MVP (text search, basic filtering)
- Medium weights (e.g., 5-7): Important features for good user experience (fuzzy matching, ranking)
- Lower weights (e.g., 1-4): Nice-to-have features or specialized capabilities (advanced voice search options)

These weights would be determined based on:
- Business requirements and priorities
- User needs assessment
- Technical feasibility
- Impact on overall search quality

For example, basic text search might have a weight of 10, while a specialized filtering capability might have a weight of 3.

## Usage
This metric should be calculated during development milestones and before releases to ensure adequate feature coverage. A minimum threshold (e.g., 0.95 or 95%) should be established as a release gate.
