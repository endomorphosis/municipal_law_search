# Query Volume Handling Metric

## Mathematical Definition

$V_{capacity} = \frac{Q_{max}}{Q_{design}} > V_{threshold}$

## Detailed Parameter Definitions

- **Query Volume**: The number of search requests processed by the system per unit of time (typically measured in queries per second or QPS).

- **$Q_{max}$ (Maximum Query Volume)**: The highest number of queries per second that the search orchestration system can handle before experiencing degradation. This represents the system's upper limit under real-world conditions.

- **Degradation**: A measurable decline in the system's performance metrics when operating under high load. Degradation can manifest as:
  - Increased response times beyond acceptable thresholds
  - Higher error rates
  - Increased rate of timeouts
  - Reduced quality of search results
  - Resource exhaustion (memory, CPU, connections)

- **$Q_{design}$ (Design Query Volume)**: The expected peak query volume that the system is specifically designed to handle efficiently. This is derived from:
  - Historical peak usage patterns
  - Growth projections
  - Anticipated usage during special events or promotions
  - Safety margin above normal peak load (typically 20-30%)

- **$V_{threshold}$ (Capacity Ratio Threshold)**: The minimum acceptable ratio between maximum capacity and design load, representing the system's "headroom." A value of 1.5 means the system should handle at least 50% more traffic than the expected peak before degrading.

## Measurement Methodology

To effectively measure this metric:

1. Establish baseline $Q_{design}$ through analysis of historical data and growth projections
2. Conduct load testing to determine $Q_{max}$ by incrementally increasing query volume until degradation occurs
3. Calculate $V_{capacity}$ and compare against the defined threshold
4. Regularly reassess as usage patterns evolve

## Target Values

- **Minimum Acceptable**: $V_{threshold} = 1.2$ (20% headroom)
- **Target Value**: $V_{threshold} = 1.5$ (50% headroom)
- **Excellent Performance**: $V_{threshold} = 2.0$ (100% headroom)
