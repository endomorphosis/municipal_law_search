and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [unreleased]

### Added

- Implemented core SearchEngine class with dependency injection pattern
- Added multiple search capability methods:
  - `text_search`: Text-based search functionality
  - `image_search`: Image-based search capability
  - `voice_search`: Voice-based search functionality
  - `exact_match`: Exact string matching capability
  - `fuzzy_match`: Approximate string matching with configurable thresholds
  - `string_exclusion`: Filter results by excluding specific strings
  - `filter_criteria`: Apply arbitrary filtering criteria to search results
  - `ranking_algorithm`: Sort and rank search results based on relevance
  - `multi_field_search`: Search across multiple fields with field-specific weighting
  - `query_parser`: Parse and normalize search queries for improved accuracy
- Implemented performance measurement capabilities:
  - `measure_response_time`: Track end-to-end response time
  - `measure_processing_time`: Measure query preprocessing time
  - `measure_database_time`: Measure database operation time
  - `measure_ranking_time`: Measure result ranking time
  - `measure_response_time_async`: Async version of response time measurement
- Added query volume handling methods:
  - `measure_query_capacity`: Calculate capacity ratio
  - `set_design_query_volume`: Configure expected peak query volume
  - `get_design_query_volume`: Retrieve current design query volume setting
  - `measure_max_query_volume`: Determine maximum query volume before degradation
  - `detect_load_degradation`: Identify approaching capacity limits
- Implemented dependency resilience features:
  - `measure_dependency_resilience`: Calculate overall resilience ratio
  - `track_dependency_failure`: Record dependency failures and recovery attempts
  - `reset_dependency_tracking`: Reset dependency tracking counters
  - `get_dependency_resilience`: Get resilience metrics for specific dependencies
  - `circuit_breaker_status`: Circuit breaker pattern for dependency management
- Added error rate monitoring methods:
  - `measure_error_rate`: Calculate current error rate
  - `track_errors`: Record error occurrences
  - `track_operations`: Record successful and failed operations
  - `reset_error_tracking`: Reset error and operation counters
  - `classify_error`: Categorize errors by type and severity
- Comprehensive event logging and monitoring throughout search operations
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation for improved resilience
- Configurable thresholds for performance and error monitoring
- Comprehensive Google-style docstrings for all methods

### Fixed

- Properly managed resource allocation and cleanup in search operations
- Improved error handling throughout the search pipeline
- Fixed potential concurrency issues with thread-safe counters
- Added proper parameter validation to prevent errors

## [0.1.0] - 2025-05-15
