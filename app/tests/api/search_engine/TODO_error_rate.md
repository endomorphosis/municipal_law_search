# Error Rate Test TODO Items

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Implement Error Tracking Methods in SearchEngine Class:**
   - Add the following methods for error monitoring:
     - `measure_error_rate`: Calculate the current error rate
     - `track_errors`: Record occurrence of errors
     - `track_operations`: Record successful and failed operations
     - `reset_error_tracking`: Reset error and operation counters
     - `classify_error`: Categorize errors by type and severity

2. **Update Search Method Implementation:**
   - Modify the `search` method to track operations and errors
   - Implement error handling with appropriate logging
   - Add error recovery mechanisms where possible

3. **Develop Error Monitoring System:**
   - Create a mechanism to periodically check error rates
   - Implement alerting when error rates exceed thresholds
   - Add comprehensive logging for error diagnostics

## Error Classification Implementation

**Error Classification Methodology:**
- Implement a system to categorize errors based on:
  - Error source (database, search algorithm, external dependency)
  - Error type (timeout, connection failure, invalid query)
  - Error severity (critical, major, minor)
- Track detailed error information including:
  - Stack traces
  - Query details (sanitized for security)
  - System state at time of error
  - Resource utilization

## Threshold Configuration

**Error Rate Threshold Management:**
- The current threshold is set at 0.01 (1%) for general tests and 0.05 (5%) for error injection tests
- Make thresholds configurable based on:
  - System maturity
  - Criticality of the application
  - User tolerance for errors
  - Types of errors (weighted error rate)
- Consider implementing tiered thresholds:
  - Critical errors: < 0.001 (0.1%)
  - Major errors: < 0.01 (1%)
  - Minor errors: < 0.05 (5%)

## Error Injection Framework

**Enhance Error Injection Capabilities:**
- Create a comprehensive error injection framework to simulate:
  - Database failures (connection loss, query timeout, corrupt results)
  - Search algorithm failures (invalid query processing, ranking failures)
  - Resource exhaustion (memory, CPU, connections)
  - External dependency failures
  - Partial failures (degraded performance but not complete failure)

## Recovery Testing

**Implement Recovery Testing:**
- Add tests for automatic recovery mechanisms
- Verify graceful degradation when components fail
- Test failover to backup systems or algorithms
- Measure recovery time after failures

## Asynchronous Implementation

**Async Support Development:**
- Ensure error tracking works correctly with async/await patterns
- Implement async-compatible error handling
- Prepare for future async database implementation

## Documentation

**Update Error Handling Documentation:**
- Document expected error scenarios and handling strategies
- Provide troubleshooting guides for common errors
- Document error rate expectations and acceptable thresholds
- Create runbooks for handling different types of errors

## Error Reporting

**Implement Error Reporting System:**
- Create dashboards for error monitoring
- Implement trend analysis for error rates over time
- Develop automated error reports for stakeholders
- Provide detailed error diagnostics for developers
