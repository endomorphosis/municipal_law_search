# Query Volume Handling Test TODO Items

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Implement Query Volume Measurement Methods in SearchEngine Class:**
   - Add the following methods for capacity measurement and management:
     - `measure_query_capacity`: Calculate the capacity ratio
     - `set_design_query_volume`: Configure the expected peak query volume
     - `get_design_query_volume`: Retrieve the current design query volume setting
     - `measure_max_query_volume`: Determine the maximum query volume before degradation
     - `detect_load_degradation`: Identify when the system is approaching capacity limits

2. **Develop Load Testing Framework:**
   - Create a framework for realistic load testing
   - Implement mechanisms to gradually increase load until degradation
   - Add instrumentation to monitor system behavior under load

3. **Implement Performance Degradation Detection:**
   - Add monitoring for key performance indicators:
     - Response time increases
     - Error rate increases
     - Resource utilization (CPU, memory, connections)
     - Query queue length

## Capacity Measurement Implementation

**Query Volume Measurement Methodology:**
- Implement realistic load testing scenarios that:
  - Generate varied query patterns
  - Simulate concurrent clients with different query behaviors
  - Apply sustained load over extended periods
  - Include periodic load spikes
- Measure degradation signals:
  - Response time distribution (average, median, 95th percentile)
  - Error rate changes
  - Resource utilization patterns
  - Query timeout frequency

## Threshold Configuration

**Volume Capacity Threshold Management:**
- The current threshold is set at 1.5 (50% headroom)
- Make thresholds configurable based on:
  - System criticality
  - Expected load patterns
  - Infrastructure elasticity
  - Budget constraints
- Consider implementing tiered thresholds:
  - Minimum Acceptable: 1.2 (20% headroom)
  - Target Value: 1.5 (50% headroom)
  - Excellent Performance: 2.0 (100% headroom)

## Load Testing Environment

**Enhance Load Testing Environment:**
- Create a more sophisticated load testing framework that can:
  - Simulate real-world query patterns
  - Generate mixed query types (simple, complex, aggregations)
  - Model diurnal load patterns
  - Introduce controlled chaos (simulated infrastructure issues)
- Develop load testing scenarios for:
  - Steady-state operation
  - Sudden load spikes
  - Gradual load increases
  - Long-running high load

## Automated Capacity Testing

**Implement Automated Capacity Testing:**
- Create pipelines for regular capacity testing
- Develop mechanisms to identify capacity regression
- Implement alerting for capacity changes
- Integrate with CI/CD to prevent capacity-reducing changes

## Documentation

**Update Capacity Management Documentation:**
- Document capacity expectations and requirements
- Create capacity planning guidelines
- Provide recommendations for scaling
- Include performance tuning suggestions
- Document load balancing strategies

## Scaling Strategy

**Develop Scaling Strategy:**
- Design horizontal scaling mechanisms
- Implement load shedding for extreme cases
- Create prioritization for critical queries
- Develop caching strategies for common queries
- Design database connection pooling optimizations
