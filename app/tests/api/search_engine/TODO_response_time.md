# Response Time Test TODO Items

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Implement Time Measurement Methods in SearchEngine Class:**
   - Add the following methods to measure different components of response time:
     - `measure_response_time`: Measure total end-to-end response time
     - `measure_processing_time`: Measure query preprocessing time
     - `measure_database_time`: Measure database operation time
     - `measure_ranking_time`: Measure result ranking time
     - `measure_response_time_async`: Async version of response time measurement

2. **Update Search Method Implementation:**
   - Modify the `search` method to track and log component times
   - Add instrumentation to capture precise timing information
   - Ensure timing measurements do not significantly impact performance

3. **Develop Performance Monitoring:**
   - Create a mechanism to periodically check response times
   - Implement alerting when response times exceed thresholds
   - Add logging for performance metrics

## Time Measurement Implementation

**Time Measurement Methodology:**
- Implement high-precision timing using appropriate Python libraries (e.g., `time.perf_counter()`)
- Ensure measurements account for system load variations
- Consider statistical approaches (average over multiple runs, percentiles)
- Track each component separately:
  - Query preprocessing and orchestration
  - Database operations (both SQL and vector)
  - Result ranking and post-processing

## Threshold Configuration

**Response Time Threshold Management:**
- The current threshold is set at 500ms (0.5 seconds)
- Make thresholds configurable based on:
  - Query complexity
  - Expected result set size
  - System load conditions
  - User expectations and requirements
- Consider implementing tiered thresholds:
  - Optimal: < 200ms
  - Acceptable: < 500ms
  - Maximum: < 1000ms

## Asynchronous Implementation

**Async Support Development:**
- Implement async-compatible timing methods
- Ensure timing measurements work correctly with async/await patterns
- Consider the impact of async event loop on timing measurements
- Prepare for future async database implementation by:
  - Creating async-compatible timing decorators
  - Designing async measurement methods that mirror sync versions
  - Supporting both sync and async operation modes

## Mock Enhancement

**Improve Mock Objects:**
- Create more realistic mock behaviors that simulate:
  - Variable response times based on query complexity
  - Occasional slowdowns to test degradation scenarios
  - Network latency and connection overhead
  - Database connection pooling behavior

## Performance Testing Framework

**Test Framework Enhancements:**
- Implement load testing capabilities to measure response time under:
  - High query volume conditions
  - Concurrent query processing
  - Sustained operation over extended periods
- Create performance regression tests to track changes over time
- Develop benchmarking tools to compare different implementations

## Documentation

**Update Class Documentation:**
- Document response time expectations and guarantees
- Provide examples of acceptable vs. unacceptable response times
- Explain factors affecting response time and optimization strategies
- Include recommendations for configuration based on usage patterns

## Metrics Reporting

**Implement Performance Metrics Reporting:**
- Create dashboards for response time monitoring
- Track response time metrics over time
- Generate alerts for performance degradation
- Provide detailed breakdowns of where time is spent
